CTL were mixed 1:1 with targets. 1mug/ml PHA or anti-CD3 (UCHT-1) was added for conjugation of human CTL. Conjugates were left in suspension at RT for 5 min then plated in individual wells of 4-well plastic tissue culture plates (Nunc) and transferred to 37°C for a further 30-60 min. Samples were fixed and processed for DAB-cytochemistry, post-fixed with reduced osmium and EPON embedded. semi-thick were stained with lead citrate and coated with 10nm fiducial gold markers for tomograhpic reconstruction.  A tilt series of images was obtained using an FEI Tecnai F30 with a Gatan flip-flop holder, spanning -68 to 68° at 1° intervals."},

Here they probably fuse with the membrane and excrete the cytotoxic proteins that trigger the death of the target cell."},
