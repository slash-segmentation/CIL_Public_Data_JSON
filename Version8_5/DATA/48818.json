On each mouse of the parabiotic pair, MC38-Cerulean cancer cells were injected on the distal flank. This folder contains images from the tumor grown in the COL-EGFP mouse, freshly explanted and analyzed ex vivo. The blue channel shows cancer cells, the red channel shows DsRed cells, the green channel shows COL-EGFP+ fibroblasts. Image name: 120513 Parabiot Rag MC57 COLEGFP tumor flank.lif - 6 Project: 20389"
