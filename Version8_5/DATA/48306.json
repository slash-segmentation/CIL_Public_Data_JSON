Immediately following, images were acquired using the fiber-optics confocal microscopy system equipped with a custom fiber-optics microprobe (UltraMiniO; Mauna Kea Technologies, Paris, France). Using this imaging protocol, we acquired two-dimensional images sequences of the tissue regions at a lateral resolution (xy dimensions), optical sectioning (z), field of view (xy), frame rate, and z-scan range of 1.8 μm, 10 μm, 169 by 120 μm, 12 Hz and 50 μm, respectively. Example images from image sequences were stored as FCMtopical."},
