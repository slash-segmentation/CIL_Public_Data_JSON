The image was taken 5 minutes after internalization, at which point most of the EGFR-gold has reached early endosomes (black dots, marked by arrowheads), but has not yet entered late endosomes or lysosomes. The cells were also loaded with transferrin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (TfHRP). The HRP catalyses a reaction in the presence of DAB that produces an electron dense product in the transferrin-containing compartments in the image. After a 1h preincubation in serum-free medium, cells were exposed to TfHRP and then incubated with EGF and anti-EGFR 10 nm gold-conjugated antibody for 30 minutes at 4C, washed, and incubated at 37C for a further 5 minutes, all in the presence of TfHRP. Cells were then room temperature fixed in 2% PFA/1.5% glutaraldehyde, a DAB reaction was carried out, and the cells were osmium stained, tannic acid treated, dehydrated, embedded en face in epon, and ~70 nm sections were cut and observed in a Philips 400 TEM. Images were recorded on film and subsequently digitized with a Flextight Precision II scanner (Imacon). Images were processed for brightness/contrast and annotations in Adobe Photoshop 5.0\n\n See also: Doyotte, A., Russell, M.R.G., Hopkins, C.R., Woodman, P.G.
