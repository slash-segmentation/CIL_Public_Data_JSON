Cells on cover slips were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 1% osmium tetroxide, stained en bloc with uranyl acetate, dehydrated and embedded in Araldite. Sections were taken parallel to the cover slip, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philips 300 transmission electron microscope. Images were captured on film, printed onto photographic paper, digitized with a scanner and processed with Photoshop (Adobe)."},
